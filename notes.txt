notes

1. arrays
    a.python uses insert: insert places it 
    b. can't append to empty list python
    c. pop
        i. list.pop() will remove last element, 
        ii. list.pop(index) will remove from index position starting with 0.
        iii. list.pop(-index) will remove from index position starting with 1, but from the back of the list.
3. framework learnings: 
    a. how to build classes
    b. how to add functions to classes
    c. how to work with self
    d. how to work with __init__
4. using if __name__ == "__main__" in py
5. need to call functions that need no ARGUMENTS as object.class(). Just object.class does not work.\
6. to add stuff in print, just use ,
7. Python uses ~ instead of !
8. Difference between Tries and Trees? (see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4737904/difference-between-tries-and-trees)
9. dict
    a. to add we use dict.update({key: value})
    b. to remove we use dict.pop(key)
    c. len also works to show # of key value pairs
